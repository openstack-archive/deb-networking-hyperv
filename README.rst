networking-hyperv
=================

This project tracks the work to integrate the Hyper-V networking with Neutron.
This project contains the Hyper-V Neutron Agent, Security Groups Driver, and
ML2 Mechanism Driver, which are used to properly bind neutron ports on a
Hyper-V host.

This project resulted from the neutron core vendor decomposition.

Supports Python 2.7, Python 3.3, Python 3.4, and Python 3.5.

How to Install
--------------

Run the following command to install the agent on the system:

::

    C:\networking-hyperv> python setup.py install

To use the ``neutron-hyperv-agent``, the Neutron Controller will have to be
properly configured. For this, the config option ``core_plugin`` in the
``/etc/neutron/neutron.conf`` file must be set as follows:

::

    core_plugin = neutron.plugins.ml2.plugin.Ml2Plugin

Additionally, ``hyperv`` will have to be added as a mechanism driver in the
``/etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini`` configuration file:

::

    mechanism_drivers = openvswitch,hyperv

In order for these changes to take effect, the ``neutron-server`` service will
have to be restarted.

Finally, make sure the ``tenant_network_types`` field contains network types
supported by Hyper-V: local, flat, vlan, gre.


Tests
-----

You will have to install the test dependencies first to be able to run the
tests.

::

    C:\networking-hyperv> pip install -r requirements.txt
    C:\networking-hyperv> pip install -r test-requirements.txt

You can run the unit tests with the following command.

::

    C:\networking-hyperv> nosetests hyperv\tests
